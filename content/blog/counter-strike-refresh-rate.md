Ever wondered why your friends had higher kills than yourself?

Well, sometimes, to put it in a harsh way, you might not be that great of a player at all. But, sometimes it is probably not your fault, it is probably your Monitor or your Laptop Screen.

Have you ever felt like they were one step ahead of you every time you tried to shoot them, it is not your fault again, they were literally one step ahead of you, provided they are playing the game on a better screen than you are.

## The Real Enemy: Low Refresh Rate

So the enemy you have to kill is not your opponent, but the sole thing called as **LOW REFRESH RATE**.

You might have heard about this term, well, refresh rate is the number of times the screen displays an image per second. The lower it is, the higher the gap between images.

So next time, you don't see the player and you are suddenly shot in your game, it is because your friend has seen you a split second earlier on his high refresh fully spec'd gaming laptop. Here is a small illustration of how this works. Observe how stuttery and delayed the image is on a 60Hz screen.

That 60Hz screen is yours and the 144Hz is how your opponent sees you, he sees you first and gets you first, lol.

## The Hardware Advantage

### 60Hz vs 144Hz: The Reality Check

When you're playing on a 60Hz monitor, you're seeing 60 frames per second. Your friend with a 144Hz gaming setup? They're seeing 144 frames per second. That's more than double the visual information.

In fast-paced games like Counter-Strike, this difference can be the deciding factor between:

- Getting the first shot vs. getting shot first
- Spotting enemies around corners vs. missing them entirely
- Smooth tracking vs. stuttery aim

### It's Not Just About Skill

The gaming community often focuses on:

- Crosshair placement
- Game sense
- Map knowledge
- Reaction time

But hardware plays a bigger role than most people realize. Your mechanical skill might be on point, but if your display is bottlenecking your performance, you're fighting an uphill battle.

## Put Your Friends to the Test

So, next time your friend who always shoots down everyone says that they are a better CS player, ask them about their refresh rate. If they don't know the concept, they will argue with you, but if they know about it, re-compete with similar specs, and I bet you will do better than before.

### The Fair Competition Challenge

Here's how to level the playing field:

1. **Check the specs** - Ask about monitor refresh rates, input lag, and response times
2. **Equalize the hardware** - Play on identical setups for a true skill comparison
3. **Compare the results** - You might be surprised by how much closer the competition becomes

## Beyond Refresh Rate

While refresh rate is crucial, other factors matter too:

- **Input lag** - The delay between your mouse click and the action on screen
- **Response time** - How quickly pixels change color
- **Frame rate** - Your GPU's ability to push high FPS consistently

## The Bottom Line

Don't let anyone convince you that hardware doesn't matter in competitive gaming. While skill is ultimately king, having the right tools can unlock your true potential.

Your aim might be better than you think - your monitor just needs to catch up.
